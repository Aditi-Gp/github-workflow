## Steps to Push Changes

### 1. Navigate to Your Local Repository

Open your terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory of your local repository:

```bash
cd path/to/your/repository
```

### 2. Check the Remote Configuration

Verify that the remote repository is set up correctly:

```bash
git remote -v
```

If the remote named `origin` does not exist, add it using:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

### 3. Stage Your Changes

Stage the files you want to commit:

- To stage specific files:

  ```bash
  git add filename1 filename2
  ```

- To stage all changes:

  ```bash
  git add .
  ```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Commit your staged changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

### 5. Push Your Changes to GitHub

Push your changes to the remote repository. If you are pushing to the `main` branch, use:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `main` with the name of your branch if you are working on a different one.

### 6. Authentication

If prompted for your username and password:

- Enter your GitHub username.
- For the password, use a **personal access token** instead of your GitHub password. 

To generate a personal access token:

1. Go to your GitHub account settings.
2. Navigate to **Developer settings**.
3. Click on **Personal access tokens** and then **Generate new token**.
4. Select the appropriate scopes and generate the token.
5. Copy the token and use it as your password when prompted.

### 7. Verify the Push

To confirm that your changes have been pushed successfully, visit your GitHub repository in a web browser.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will allow you to push changes from your local repository to your GitHub repository. If you encounter any issues, refer to the GitHub documentation or seek assistance.

### Additional Notes
